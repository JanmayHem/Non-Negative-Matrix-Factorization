# Non-Negative-Matrix-Factorization
Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a technique to decompose a matrix of non-negative values into two smaller matrices, also with non-negative values. It can be used for dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, clustering, and other applications. This GitHub repository contains the implementation of NMF from scratch, using various optimization algorithms such as gradient descent, multiplicative update, and alternating least squares. The code is written in Python and uses NumPy for matrix operations. The repository also includes some examples of applying NMF to image and text data, as well as a comparison of the performance and accuracy of different algorithms. If you are interested in learning more about NMF and how to implement it, this repository is for you.

In this repository we look at a simple application of NMF to find out facial features and then reconstruct those face images using our updated Feature and Weight matrices.
